[1.821s]   By not providing "FindInferenceEngine.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
[1.821s]   project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
[1.821s]   "InferenceEngine", but CMake did not find one.
[1.821s] 
[1.821s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "InferenceEngine"

[1.822s] 
[1.822s]   Add the installation prefix of "InferenceEngine" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
[1.822s]   set "InferenceEngine_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
[1.822s]   If "InferenceEngine" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
[1.822s]   sure it has been installed.
